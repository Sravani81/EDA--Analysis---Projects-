# EDA--Analysis---Projects-
In my projects 
**Data Transformation:** I utilized Python and the Pandas library to perform data transformation, ensuring that the dataset was properly prepared for analysis.

**Data Cleaning:** With Pandas, I conducted data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types, to improve data quality.

**Data Visualization**: I employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create data visualizations, including charts and graphs, to effectively communicate insights and patterns found in the data.

**Numerical Operations**: Various Python libraries, including NumPy, were employed to carry out numerical operations, facilitating data calculations and transformations.

**Statistical Analysis**: I used the SciPy library for statistical analysis, enabling a deeper exploration of the dataset and uncovering meaningful statistical insights.

These Python libraries played a crucial role in the successful execution of data transformation and cleaning, ultimately contributing to the thorough exploration of the dataset.
